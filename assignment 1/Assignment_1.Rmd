## Q1-Part(a)  

*Plot the following two items using the normal ogive model over the range..*  

**My Solution: **  
  
  
First, I define the normal ogive model.  

```{r}
# define the theta
theta <- seq(-3,3, by=0.1)

# define the normal ogive model
nom_2pl <- function(theta, a, b){
  # get the probit vector
  Z <- a*(theta-b)
  func_ <- function(probit){(1/sqrt(2*pi))*exp(-0.5*probit^2)}
  p_list <- c()
  # using a for loop to get the p iteratively
  for (i in 1:length(Z)) {
    # get the CDF
    p_i <- integrate(func_, -Z[i], Inf)
    # store the result
    p_list[i] <- p_i
  }
  return(p_list)
}
```  
Then, using the function above to plot the ICCs for two items.  
For the item 1 with $\alpha=1$ and $\beta =1$.  

```{r, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE,fig.show='hold',out.width="100%",out.height= "50%"}
# Item 1: a=1, b=1
# define the xlim
xlim_min <- -3
xlim_max <- 3
P_item1_nom <- nom_2pl(theta=theta,a=1,b=1)
plot(theta, P_item1_nom, type = "l", 
     col="red", xlim = c(xlim_min,xlim_max), ylim = c(0,1),
     main = "Item 1, a=1, b=1", ylab = "P(theta)")

# add a horizontal line at p=0.5 to see the b value
abline(h=0.5, col="blue", lty=2)
abline(v=1, col="blue", lty=2)
grid()
```  
  
For the Item 2 with $\alpha=.5957$ and $\beta=-0.5$.  

```{r}
# Item 1: a=.5957, b=-.5
# par(mfrow=c(1,2))
P_item2_nom <- nom_2pl(theta=theta,a=.5957,b=-0.5)
plot(theta, P_item2_nom, type = "l", 
     col="red", xlim = c(xlim_min,xlim_max), ylim = c(0,1),
     main = "Item 2, a=.5957, b=-0.5", ylab = "P(theta)")

# add a horizontal line at p=0.5 to see the b value
abline(h=0.5, col="blue", lty=2)
abline(v=-0.5, col="blue", lty=2)
grid()
```  
  
## Q1-Part(b)  

*Plot the following two items using a logistic model over the range..*  

**My Solution: **  

Like before, I defined the model first. This time, the model is much simpler.  

```{r}
logit_2pl <- function(theta, a, b){
  # get the logit
  Z <- a*(theta-b)
  # get the probability
  P <- 1/(1 + exp(-Z))
  return(P)
}
```  
  
Then, using the function above to plot the ICCs for two items.  
For the item 1 with $\alpha=1$ and $\beta =1$.  
```{r}
P_item1_logit <- logit_2pl(theta=theta,a=1,b=1)
plot(theta, P_item1_logit, type = "l", 
     col="darkgreen",  xlim = c(xlim_min,xlim_max), ylim = c(0,1),
     main = "Item 1, a=1, b=1", ylab = "P(theta)")

# add a horizontal line at p=0.5 to see the b value
abline(h=0.5, col="blue", lty=2)
abline(v=1, col="blue", lty=2)
grid()
```  

For the Item 2 with $\alpha=.5957$ and $\beta=-0.5$.  
```{r}
# Item 1: a=.5957, b=-.5
# par(mfrow=c(1,2))
P_item2_logit <- logit_2pl(theta=theta,a=.5957,b=-0.5)
plot(theta, P_item2_logit, type = "l", 
     col="darkgreen", xlim = c(xlim_min,xlim_max), ylim = c(0,1),
     main = "Item 2, a=.5957, b=-0.5", ylab = "P(theta)")

# add a horizontal line at p=0.5 to see the b value
abline(h=0.5, col="blue", lty=2)
abline(v=-0.5, col="blue", lty=2)
grid()
```  

  
## Q1-Part(c)  

*Compare the two plots in (b) with the two plots in part (a). What do you find?..*  

**My Solution: **  
  
For better comparison, I combined the item 1's ICCs from two model, and so did item 2.  
ICCs for item 1. 
```{r}
plot(theta, P_item1_nom, type = "l", 
     col="red", xlim = c(xlim_min,xlim_max), ylim = c(0,1),
     main = "Item 1's ICCs, a=1, b=1", ylab = "P(theta)")
lines(theta, P_item1_logit, col="green")
abline(h=0.5, col="blue", lty=2)
abline(v=1, col="blue", lty=2)
grid()
# add legend
legend('bottomright',inset=0.05,
       c("Normal Ogive","Logistic"),lty=1,
       col=c("red","green"),title="Graph type",
       cex=0.8)
```   
The plot shows that ICCs intersect at the $P(\theta) = 0.5$ with a same corresponding $\beta = 1$. However, the slope of logistic model's ICC is lighter than it from the normal ogive model.  
  
Next, I use the converted $\alpha_c = 1.702\alpha$ to re-plot the ICCs.  
```{r}
# adjust the alpha
P_item1_logit <- logit_2pl(theta=theta,a=1*1.702,b=1)
# replot the two ICCs
plot(theta, P_item1_nom, type = "l", 
     col="red", xlim = c(xlim_min,xlim_max), ylim = c(0,1),
     main = "Item 1's ICCs, a=1, b=1", ylab = "P(theta)")
lines(theta, P_item1_logit, col="green")
abline(h=0.5, col="blue", lty=2)
abline(v=1, col="blue", lty=2)
grid()
# add legend
legend('bottomright',inset=0.05,
       c("Normal Ogive","Logistic"),lty=1,
       col=c("red","green"),title="Graph type",
       cex=0.8)
```  
Now, the two ICCs are pretty close to each other.  
Item 2 will have the same phenomenon, I skip plotting the item 2 for space saving.  

## Q2-Part(a)  

*Plot the ICCs of the five items in the ...*  

**My Solution: **  
Using the function created above to plot five ICCs on one plot. Logistic model with converted $\alpha$ is used. I use 1PL model since the discrimination information is not mentioned.
```{r}  
# define the beta vector as input
B <- c(-2, -1, -0.5, 0.5, 1)

# using a for loop to get all results
Ps <- list()
for (i in 1:length(B)){
  # note a is a constant with value of 1.702 in 1PL model.
  P_item1_logit <- logit_2pl(theta=theta,a=1.702,b=B[i])
  # store the result into a list
  Ps[[i]] <- P_item1_logit
}

# plot all five ICCs on same plot
# replot the two ICCs
plot(theta, Ps[[1]], type = "l", 
     col="red", xlim = c(xlim_min,xlim_max), ylim = c(0,1),
     main = "5 ICCs using 1pl logistic model", ylab = "P(theta)")
# using a for loop to plot the rest 4 ICCs
for (i in c(2:5)) {
  lines(theta, Ps[[i]], col="red")
}
abline(h=0.5, col="blue", lty=2)
grid()
```  

## Q2-Part(b)  

*Compare the probabilities of correct response for Items ...*  

**My Solution: **  

For this 1PL model, item 1 ($\beta=-2$) is easier than item 4 ($\beta=0.5$). For example, for an examinee with trait level of 0 (i.e., $\theta = 0$), the probabilities to correctly answer the item 1 is around $.96$ and around $.3$ for item 4. Same phenomenon can be also found for the examinees with a shared trait level across the trait range $[-3,3]$. However, at the two extreme ends (i.e., the negative infinity and the positive infinity), the probabilities should be same, either 0 or 1.  


## Q2-Part(c)  

*Which of the five items is easiest ...*  

**My Solution: **  
The easiest item is item 1, and the item 5 is the most difficult. Yes. By definition, the diffculty is an item's characteristic conditional on $\theta$. Therefore, Are these statements true for all $\theta$.  


## Q2-Part(d)  

*Find TCC and Plot TCC ...*  

**My Solution: **  
By defintion, the TCC is sum of the $P(\theta_j)$ for all items.  
```{r}
# get the sum of all P_thetas
P_tcc <- Ps[[1]] + Ps[[2]] + Ps[[3]] + Ps[[4]] + Ps[[5]]

# plot the TCC across thetas
plot(theta, P_tcc, type = "l", 
     col="red", xlim = c(xlim_min,xlim_max), ylim = c(0,6),
     main = "TCC", ylab = "P(theta)")
abline(v=-1, col="blue", lty=2)
abline(v=1, col="blue", lty=2)
grid()
```  

## Q2-Part(e)  

*TCC also represents the expected number of correct responses ...*  

**My Solution: **  
From the plot above, one might expect an examinee with the trait $\theta=-1.0$ to correctly answer around $1.9$ items, and above $4$ items for an examinee with the trait at $\theta=1$.  

## Q3-Part(a)  

*Find the mean of Item 6 and its correlation with ...*  

**My Solution: **  

For group 1, the difficulty(easiness) is $.510$ and the discrimination (using point bi-serial) is $.276$.  
For group 2, the difficulty(easiness) is $.670$ and the discrimination is $.553$.  

## Q3-Part(b)  

*Do the indices remain the same across the two groups ...*  

**My Solution: **  
The indices are not the same across the groups. Since one limitation of CTT is sample-dependent. Different sample will return different item characteristics. CTT does not guarantee a indices invariance.  

## Q3-Part(c)  

*Which group has higher ability ...*  

**My Solution: **  

The Group 2's ability is greater than Group 1 since the average total score is higher in Group 2.  


## Q4  

*Responses to three items at a fixed ability level can be ...*  

**My Solution: **  
The contingency tables for each pair as followed:  
![]("q4.png"){width=50%}  

Next, I use the built-in function in R to conduct the $\chi^2$ test. Note, the null hypothesis of $\chi^2$ test is that the variables are independent.

```{r}
# load the data
df <- read.csv("~/Desktop/PhD_Learning/HUDM6052 Psychometric II/assignment 1/hw1_4.csv")  

# chi-square test for item 1 and 2
result_12 <- chisq.test(table(df[,c(1,2)]))
result_13 <- chisq.test(table(df[,c(1,3)]))
result_23 <- chisq.test(table(df[,c(2,3)]))
(pvalue_12 <- result_12$p.value)
(pvalue_13 <- result_13$p.value)
(pvalue_23 <- result_23$p.value)
```  

The p-values from both tests of pair 1 (item 1 and item 2) and pair 3 (item 2 and item 3) are significant ($\alpha$ = .05), which means there are associations in both two pairs. Therefore, the local independent assumption does not hold for item 1 and 2 and for item item 2 and item 3. Only item 1 and item 3 are locally independent.  

## Q5  

*Using the logistic model, plot the following three items over the range ...*  

**My Solution: **  
I continue to use the function `logit_2pl()` created in the first question since it can fit for both 1PL and 2PL model. I write a new function for 3PL model as followed.  

```{r}
# write 3PL function
logit_3pl <- function(theta, a, b, c){
  # get the logit
  Z <- a*(theta-b)
  # get the probability
  P <- c + (1-c)/(1 + exp(-Z))
  return(P)
}
```  
Then, I calculate the probability vector for each model.  
```{r}
# for the 1Pl model, b=0.5
P_1pl <- logit_2pl(theta=theta, a=1, b=0.5)
# for the 2PL model, a=1.5, b=0.5
P_2pl <- logit_2pl(theta = theta, a=1.5, b=0.5)
# for the 3PL model, a=1.5, b=0.5, c=0.15
P_3pl <- logit_3pl(theta = theta, a=1.5, b=0.5, c=0.15)
```  
Next, plot all 3 ICCs on same plot.  
```{r}
plot(theta, P_1pl, type = "l", 
     col="red", xlim = c(xlim_min,xlim_max), ylim = c(0,1),
     main = "ICCs for 3 Models", ylab = "P(theta)")
lines(theta, P_2pl, col="darkgreen")
lines(theta, P_3pl, col="purple")
abline(h=0.5, col="blue", lty=2)
abline(h=0.575, col="blue", lty=2)
grid()
# add legend
legend('bottomright',inset=0.05,
       c("1PL","2PL","3PL"),lty=1,
       col=c("red","darkgreen","purple"),title="Graph type",
       cex=0.8)
```  

## Q6  

*For the three-parameter logistic model ...*  

**My Solution: **  
By definition, the 3PL model is $$P(\theta)= c+ (1-c)\frac{1}{1+e^{-\alpha(\theta-\beta)}} .$$  
Set the $\theta = \beta$, we have $$P(\theta = \beta)= c+ (1-c)\frac{1}{1+e^0} .$$  
Since the $e^0 = 1$, finally, we have $$P(\theta = \beta)= c+ (1-c)\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{2} (1+c) .$$
